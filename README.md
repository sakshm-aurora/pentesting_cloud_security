# Pentesting &amp; Securing Cloud Network

# Summary
This project was part of my summer training at ICT-IIT Kanpur in Cyber Security.
I created my own cloud environment using Amazon Web Services EC2 & ownCloud to store files remotely on cloud , hardened itâ€™s security by implementing AV , IDS & Honeypot.
Next, I performed penetration testing on the same secured cloud network.

# Cloud Creation
1. Registered on AWS , launched a RHEL 8 instance with requried security group configurations
2. Created a cloud environment in the RHEL system by using LAMP and ownCloud.
3. Created User's and Groups in the ownCloud environment.
4. Allowed user to share files and limit the disk usage to 2 GB/user

# Security
1. Secure ownCloud from Malicious files uploads using CalmAV
2. Configured IDS (Snort) and configured rule for http, icmp
3. Configured Honeypots so that attackers check open ports and try to attack on server

# Penetration Testing
1. Bypassed ClamAV in cloud and hacked the Windows/Linux OS
2. Implemented DoS attack on Cloud Server
3. Reported all the findings and vulnerabilities
4. Reported the attack type and tools which I gathered from IDS and Honeypots

# Conclusion
1. Suggestions on how can we secure cloud server from being hacked
2. Patching the loopholes from which attacker gets in
